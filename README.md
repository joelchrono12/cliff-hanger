This game was made for the  Game Endeavours Discord Game Jam!

Traverse the different levels of this huge cave, in less than 12 seconds, or else, you die!

For some reason tho, time doesnt seem to keep going when you grab on ledges and maybe some other things, idk.

Make sure to collect all of those shiny diamond thingies, they surely are important for you, I assure you!


## Controls:

SPACE  to pause

Z / ENTER to select an option in menus

AD / LR Arrows = Movement (AZERTY Support too)

Z/J = Jumping

Grab to ledges to stop time
